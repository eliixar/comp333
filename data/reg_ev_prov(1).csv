Footnotes:,,,,
1,"Starting with 2017 registration data, a new and improved method to assign vehicle types was used. As a result, comparisons to table 23-10-0067-01 is not recommended.",,,
2,This table excludes vehicles that were determined to have no Gross Vehicle Weight Rate (GVWR) and/or unknown vehicles types.,,,
3,"This tables excludes trailers and off-road categories such as snowmobiles, golf carts, etcetera.",,,
4,"In 2017, in Prince Edward Island, school buses were shifted from annual renewable registration to a non-expiring registration. This accounts for the decline in the school bus registrations. For more information, please contact the PEI Department of Transportation, Infrastructure and Energy.",,,
5,"A processing error was discovered and subsequently corrected by Prince Edward Island in 2018. As a result, the level of all categories of vehicles have shifted upward in 2018 compared to previous years. For more information, please contact the PEI Department of Transportation, Infrastructure and Energy.",,,
6,"For Quebec, the 2023 count of heavy-duty vehicle registrations was revised upward based on updated information and estimation methods.",,,
7,"For Ontario, vehicle counts were revised downward for reference year 2022. The counts initially included both active and expired vehicles due to a COVID-19 pandemic registration exemption that ended in February 2022. In addition, as of March 2022, Ontario eliminated licence plate renewal fees and stickers for passenger vehicles, light-duty trucks, motorcycles and mopeds. This led to a decrease in active registrations because some drivers overlooked the need to renew their plates, which explains part of the 3.3% decline in the 2023 counts. Beginning in July 2024, Ontario implemented an automatic registration renewal program for passenger vehicles, light-duty trucks, motorcycles and mopeds. This change contributed to an increase in active registrations in the province, as vehicles that might otherwise have lapsed were automatically renewed.",,,
