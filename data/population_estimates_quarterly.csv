Footnotes:
1,"Postcensal estimates are based on the 2021 Census counts adjusted for census net undercoverage (CNU) (including adjustment for incompletely enumerated reserves and settlements (IERS)) and the components of demographic growth that occurred since that census. Intercensal estimates are produced using counts from two consecutive censuses adjusted for CNU (including IERS) and postcensal estimates."
2,"Population estimates: Q1 = January 1; Q2 = April 1; Q3 = July 1; Q4 = October 1."
3,"Estimates are final intercensal and unadjusted for census net undercoverage prior to July 1, 1971. Estimates are final intercensal from July 1, 1971 to April 1, 2021, final postcensal from July 1, 2021 to January 1, 2022, updated postcensal from April 1, 2022 to April 1, 2025 and preliminary postcensal from July 1, 2025."
4,"The population growth, which is used to calculate population estimates, is comprised of natural increase (Table 17100059), international migration (Table 17100040) and interprovincial migration (Tables 17100020 and 17100045)."
5,"Prior to July 1, 1991, only population estimates for Northwest Territories and Nunavut combined are available."
